Welcome to my first OpenCV project, where I explore the fascinating world of image processing using Python and OpenCV. This project demonstrates fundamental image manipulation techniques such as reading, rotating, resizing, and writing images. It’s an exciting introduction to computer vision and image processing, showcasing how simple operations can transform images in various ways.

_**Key Features:**_

- **Image Reading:** Load images from your local directory into Python using OpenCV’s powerful image reading capabilities.
- **Image Rotation:** Rotate images by any angle, allowing for creative transformations and adjustments.
- **Image Resizing:** Resize images to different dimensions, making them suitable for various applications like thumbnails, banners, or responsive designs.
- **Image Writing:** Save the processed images back to your local directory, allowing you to preserve your work and share the results.

  _**How to Use:**_

1. Clone the repository to access the source code.
2. Run the Python script to perform various image manipulation tasks.
3. Customize the script to apply different operations such as reading, rotating, resizing, and writing images based on your needs.

_**Installation:**_

Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencv-image-manipulation.git
